# Snake-game
Setup:
The setup function initializes the game state, including the snake's starting position, the fruit's position, and the score.
Draw:
The draw function clears the screen and redraws the game state, including the snake, the fruit, and the score.
Input:
The input function checks for keyboard input to change the snake's direction or end the game.
Logic:
The logic function updates the snake's position, checks for collisions with the walls or itself, and handles eating the fruit.
Main Loop:
The main function runs the game loop, calling the draw, input, and logic functions, and adding a delay with Sleep.
This simple console-based Snake game provides a basic structure for a more complex game. You can expand it by adding more features, such as different levels, obstacles, and a graphical user interface.
